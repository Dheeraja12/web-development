This repository contains my front-end development samples.

The folder basic-restaurant-menu contains a responsive basic website with a css folder.
The website is responsive in desktop-view, tablet-view as well as mobile-view. 
Only pure HTML and CSS have been employed for this particular page.

The folder javascript-miniproject contains a program that takes an array of names as input and displays output based on certain conditions. Useful JavaScript features like Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs) have been employed for this purpose.
The output can be viewed on your browser's console by loading this webpage: https://dheeraja12.github.io/web-development/javascript-miniproject/
